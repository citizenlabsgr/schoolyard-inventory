**Slack:** #project-datacensus

**Project Description:**
This project will update the City of Grand Rapids' entry in the [US City Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org). Grand Rapids is currently ranked 81st in the country and has not been updated since 2014.

The [US City Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org) ranks US cities on based on 19 datasets. The Census is an ongoing, crowdsourced measure of the current state of access to a selected group of datasets in municipalities across the United States. Anyone can contribute an assessment of these datasets in their municipality at any time. Census content will be peer-reviewed periodically by a volunteer team of Census librarians coordinated by the Sunlight Foundation.

The US City Open Data Census is a web application developed and maintained by [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/), [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org/), and [Open Knowledge International](http://okfn.org/).
