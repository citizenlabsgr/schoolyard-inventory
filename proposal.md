## Green Schoolyard Inventory
April 2020

### OVERVIEW: 

How might we help educators instill meaningful connections to place with students?
In the recent Grand Rapids Environmental Education Network (GREEN) survey teachers reported that the lack of Outdoor Classrooms were a major barrier that “prevents them from teaching and working with students in an outdoor setting.”
We would like to provide teachers and students with a tool that can help develop a sense of place and connection within a local community.

### DESIRED OUTCOMES

1. Create an inventory of suitable outdoor spaces for learning either on Grand Rapids Public School (GRPS) property or within walking distance of a school.

2. Learn more about the barriers that prevent teachers from teaching and working with students in an outdoor setting.

3. Utilize students for development of digital tools and data collection to the greatest possible extent.

### SPECIFICATIONS

- Create an open source green infrastructure inventory tool. With the tool decision makers can aggregate total resources, identify areas of need, and mitigate deficiencies of specific schools.
- Leverage and integrate existing citizen science projects that can be utilized by teachers.
- Develop an interactive map that allows teachers to map out nature-based or green assets on school grounds or nearby that can be used for educational programming. As possible, link curriculum content, documents, or simply key contacts to get such information for each asset. Allow teachers to create/edit/upload new assets.

### MILESTONES

- **Educator/Student Workshop:** A user driven workshop to learn more about the needs and attitudes of educators and students to inform the development of a Green Schoolyard Inventory and other follow on projects that seek to instill meaningful connections to place with students.

- **Green Schoolyard Inventory:** Create an inventory of green resources available at GRPS and other properties, like nearby community parks. Inventory features may include: native and invasive species, access to water, outdoor classroom space, and other items as identified in the Educator/Student workshop.

- **Outdoor Learning Tool:** Leverage the Green Schoolyard Inventory data for a tool (to be developed or identified) that can be used by teachers and students to explore and learn about the natural environment of their community.
